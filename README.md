# Project Title: Building Decision Tree Classifier For Prediction

## Overview
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this project is the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
The Car Evaluation dataset contains information about car evaluations, including various categorical features that describe the buying, maintenance, safety, and other characteristics of cars. The target variable indicates the car evaluation class.

## Libraries Used

### NumPy
**NumPy** is fundamental for numerical computing in Python. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It's essential for performing calculations and data transformations.

### Pandas
**Pandas** is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which are essential for handling tabular data. Functions for reading/writing data, cleaning data (e.g., handling missing values), and transforming data (e.g., merging datasets) are provided.

### Matplotlib
**Matplotlib** is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It offers a wide variety of plots, including line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, etc. It's highly customizable and suitable for generating publication-quality figures.

### Seaborn
**Seaborn** is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations like heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, etc., with minimal code. It also enhances Matplotlib's aesthetics and integrates well with Pandas data structures.

### Scikit-learn
**Scikit-learn** is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms, including the decision tree classifier used in this project.

### Category Encoders
**Category Encoders** is a library that provides several encoding techniques for categorical variables. It is essential for transforming categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

### Graphviz
**Graphviz** is an open-source graph visualization software. It is used in this project to visualize the structure of the decision tree, making it easier to understand the model's decisions.

### Other Modules
- **os**: Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
- **warnings**: Used to manage warnings in the code, ensuring a cleaner output during execution.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Loading
Load the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using Pandas.

### 2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to ensure the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the distribution of the data and identify relationships between variables. This involves using summary statistics and visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

### 4. Feature Engineering
Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the performance of the decision tree classifier. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating interaction terms.

### 5. Model Building
Use Scikit-learn to build a decision tree classifier. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize the decision tree using Graphviz and analyze feature importance to understand the model's decisions.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize the decision tree classifier by tuning its hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings of the project, including the model's performance and any insights gained from the analysis. Discuss potential improvements and future work.
